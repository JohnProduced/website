Steps to import sample data and replicate demo site: 

The sample data file can be downloaded from - 
http://portfoliotheme.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/agile-sample-data.xml.gz


Pls follow the following steps to import sample data - 

1) If you have not done so already, pls install and activate WooCommerce plugin from 

http://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/

2) Install and activate Contact Form 7 plugin from 

https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/

Pls note that there can be errors during import if you fail to install the above plugins. If you do not need these plugins, pls IGNORE the errors reported during import which look like 

	Failed to import “Default CF7 Plugin Form”: Invalid post type wpcf7_contact_form
	Failed to import “Agile Theme Contact Form”: Invalid post type wpcf7_contact_form

	and

	Failed to import “Variation #42 of Ship Your Idea”: Invalid post type product_variation
	Failed to import “Woo Logo”: Invalid post type product
	Failed to import “Woo Album #2”: Invalid post type product
	Failed to import “Order – Nov 22, 2013 @ 12:18 PM”: Invalid post type shop_order

3) Download the Agile sample data from

Important: 

1) Please follow the VIDEO posted here for importing sample data and replicating demo site. 

The video also demonstrates setting up the Revolution Slider.

2) Pls go through the very first chapter/section in the theme documentation named “Installation and One Page Site Configuration” which provides details on how to install the theme and how to configure it to your needs. Pls read through the same for better understanding of the theme.

3) If the import fails for some reason in the middle, please retry the import. Due to sheer amount of data involved during import, import can fail due to insufficient memory or network issues. 

	a) Pls ensure the import is complete by checking for "All done. Have fun!" message after you import the file. If the importer displays no message indicating completion and just stops responding, pls retry since that will help import data IN INCREMENTS. The already imported data will NOT be repeated after each import(except menus stack up with each import but you can just delete the menu and do one last import). 

	b) Try to import first without importing attachments and then you can try importing with attachments. If you have insufficient memory allocated to your installation, the import can fail badly every time you give a try. If the import keeps failing, pls try increasing the memory as described here and if that does not help, pls contact your hosting provider to allocate more memory to your account –
